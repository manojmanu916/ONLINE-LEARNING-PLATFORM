Overview
LearnHub is an online learning platform for B.Tech engineering courses, offering user authentication, course access, messaging, and grading features. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses Firebase for authentication and emphasizes a modern, responsive design with interactive animations. The files include index.html (login), register.html, dashboard.html, welcome.html, test.html, firebaseauth.js, script.js, style.css, style1.css, and welcome.css.
File Breakdown

index.html: Login page with email/password form, password toggle, and register link.
register.html: Registration form with name, phone, email, passwords, CAPTCHA, and password match validation.
dashboard.html: Post-login interface with course list (e.g., Compiler Design), messages (assignment form), and grades (tables).
welcome.html: Landing page explaining online learning and platform goals.
test.html: Minimal file with password toggle elements, likely for testing.

JavaScript Files
